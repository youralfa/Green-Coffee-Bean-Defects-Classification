This repository contains a **17-class classification system** for green coffee bean defects, developed to align with the **Specialty Coffee Association (SCA)** standards. The system categorizes beans into 16 defect classes, including Full Black, Full Sour, Dried Cherry/Pod, Fungus Damage, Foreign Matter, Severe Insect Damage, Partial Black, Partial Sour, Parchment/Pergamino, Floater, Immature/Unripe, Withered, Shell, Broken/Chipped/Cut, Hull/Husk, and Slight Insect Damage, along with an additional class for normal beans classified as specialty-grade. The dataset comprises images captured under three distinct lighting conditions: Low Light, Medium Light, and High Light. Each image is carefully annotated and classified in accordance with the **SCA Table of Defect Equivalents**, ensuring consistency and adherence to industry standards.
